# Energy Volume Curve
Based on [previous work](https://materialdigital.github.io/ADIS2023/README.html) from the [ADIS 2023 workshop](https://www.mpie.de/4902385/adis2023)
the calculation of an energy volume curve with the [quantum espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) density 
functional theory (DFT) simulation code is implemented in the Python Workflow Definition.
